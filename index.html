              For us, art is more than paint on a canvas or pixels on a

              we make a choice to consume, the decision isn't based on logic or

              innovative and adaptable and we strive to rework each piece to
              perfection.<br /><br />On the other side, our scientific approach
              feeds our addiction in measuring and testing everything we do, to
              gather the latest insights and eliminate the guesswork.

              <p class="text-grey">
                La Chinata were planning to produce a new line of olive oil
                products to the market, branching out from natural oils used for
                cooking to a much wider range including health, cosmetics and
                fragrances.<br /><br />La Chinata approached The Buzz as they
                were aware of the limitations of their existing digital
                presence. It was clear the internet had not been an active part
                of their marketing strategy and could work much harder to
                promote their brand.
              </p>

              <p class="text-grey">
                With a broad and active target audience. La Chinata lacked the
                means to communicate directly with their existing customer base
                and to attract new customers interested in their product
                range.<br /><br />1. Our digital strategy involved creating a
                new, optimised website that would boost the brand presence
                whilst maximing the conversion rate of each visitor.<br /><br />2.
                We created a permission marketing campaign allowing La Chinata
                to nurture their relationships with existing and prospective
                customers through email and physical mail.<br /><br />3.
                Everything we created was designed in an engaging and assessable
                format elevating the La Chinata brand, encouraging trust,
                loyalty and engagement.

                A 50% increase in web traffic&nbsp;<br />– New Locations in
                Korea, Mexico and the UK.

                is a revolution in today’s printing era and presents a strong
                advantage for HP over its competitors.<br />Our challenge was to
                raise awareness of the HP brand and educate users on the
                features of the ePrint product.

                In order to introduce users to the world of ePrint, we needed to
                create an online destination.<br />Working closely with HP, we
                created the ePrint Centre which enabled visitors to:<br /><br />-
                Discover the benefits of ePrint<br />- Find ideal ePrint
                Hardware<br />- Download print apps<br />- Read the latest

                <br />customers.<br /><br />HP have confirmed that the ePrint
                Centre has been a tremendous success and we continue to work to
                closely with them on the development of numerous platform

                The Harley Owners Group (HOG) is the official riding club of
                Harley-Davidson, offering a variety of member benefits,
                membership options, and events.<br /><br />HOG was created in
                1983 as a way to build longer-lasting and stronger relationships
                with Harley-Davidson's customers, HOG members typically spend
                30% more than other Harley owners, on items such as clothing and
                Harley-Davidson-sponsored events.

                undoubtedly contributed towards this, encouraging Harley owners
                to see the benefits of being a HOG <br />member and HOG members
                to share them.

                HOG wanted to turn sales around and allow the Harley-Davidson
                company to grow again. They were keen to focus their branding
                efforts in presenting the Harley-Davidson Company as an American
                icon, with the focus on authenticity and pride in being American
                made.

                We worked alongside HOG so they could grow their database of
                members beyond their target level.<br /><br />We focused on
                three core areas:<br /><br />1. Increasing conversions of
                HOG.com visitors to HOG members<br />2. Increasing website
                traffic to HOG.com<br />3. Improving communication with
                prospective and existing HOG members<br /><br />1. We worked
                with HOG to improve both the appearance and benefits of their
                existing offer. First, we took the current perks of being a HOG
                member and upgraded them, building <br />relationships with
                partners such as AT&amp;T Wireless, Best Western and many
                others, to create unmissable incentives.<br /><br />2. We then
                took time to promote the rewards through various mediums
                including videos, handbooks and magazines.<br /><br />2. To
                generate more targeted traffic to the HOG members site, we
                created an SEO and PPC strategy focused on encouraging existing
                <br />Harley owners to view the incentives of becoming a HOG
                member.<br /><br />3. Finally, Email Marketing was used to
                improve communication with existing and prospective HOG
                members.<br /><br />We planned the email marketing campaigns
                establishing the forthcoming communication themes and broadcast
                schedule; <br />however the email design brief was open allowing
                us to interpret each message perfectly, reflecting the cutting
                edge design, and sexy, aspirational style of the brand.

                To fulfil these objectives, we advised the development of a
                microsite and once approved, carried out a full design and build
                service.<br /><br />The design needed to be kept in line with
                the Mazda brand values and exude sports, luxury and style.<br /><br />We
                created an HTML 5 interface which enabled the site to be viewed
                seamlessly on all mobile and tablet devices. High end
                photography and rich content paired with an interactive design
                and the ability to adjust car components, along with interaction
                in the social space were some of the many features included.<br /><br />We
                ran three primary calls to action across the site:<br /><br />-
                Request a Brochure<br />- Get specs &amp; prices<br />- Request
                a test drive

                140% increase in test drives booked<br />- 230% increase in
                brochures requested<br /><br />The creative execution was
                engaging and on brand. The Buzz have been asked to work as a

                time attempting to lift heavy objects and only eat foods that
                have once lived. He’s passionate about music, fine arts and
                travelling. His goal is to have a friend in every country, oh

              <div class="text-profile-member">
                Before opening his own design firm, Mark entered the digital
                scene as an art director. From there he ended up working on the
                client side of advertising at Mazda, where he got involved in
                everything from vehicle pricing to brand management. Mark then
                took a year off to explore the world and recharge before
                deciding to join us here at The Buzz. Mark has over a dozen
                years of experience in the field of design and user experience,
                and is responsible for all aspects of UX practice including
                accounts, leaderships and day to day operations. He’s our secret
                weapon for creating designs that will blow you away, he’s a
                perfectionist and everything he puts out there is nothing but
                pixel perfect. Occasionally you may find him dabbling in code,
                but don’t tell anyone!<br /><br />Mark was born and raised in
                Holland, the land of tulips, windmills and great architecture.
                He’s obsessed about great work, great advertising, great design
                . . . and he’s especially passionate about bringing out the best
                in the people he works with.
